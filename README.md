# continuous-mouse-mover
Keeps moving your mouse in every 7 second. (Just a fun little project)
Made this for one of my senior, who was doing an internship and was needed to keep doing some activity to be active on ms-teams even when he didn't had any work to do, for that he used to keep moving his mouse. So created this app, that after one click (Start Button), the mouse will automatically keep moving in every 7 seconds.
